"""stapel-reserved-paths — regenerate/verify a generated project's
``reserved-paths.json``.

Schema (agreed with ``@stapel/eslint-plugin``'s ``no-reserved-backend-route``
rule — stapel-react/packages/eslint-plugin/lib/data.js
``loadReservedPathCatalog`` + that package's own README "reserved-paths.json"
section; do not change without updating both sides)::

    {"reservedPathPrefixes": ["/admin", "/staticfiles", "/media",
                              "/<mod>/api", "/<mod>/swagger", ...]}

This is the SAME projection ``create_project._write_reserved_paths_json``
writes at generation time (nginx-local/prod-nginx/Vite all render their
backend location blocks from the sibling, richer
``create_project._reserved_paths_manifest`` — this file is the flat subset
of that manifest the frontend lint rule reads). A bare module root
(``/<mod>``) must never appear — roots belong to the frontend SPA by canon
(the "/calendar page vs backend" collision this whole mechanism exists to
prevent).

``--check`` is the pre-commit drift gate (``reserved-paths-check``, wired
into a monolith's ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` next to
``config-manifest-check``/``presenter-catalog-check``): it recovers the
module set already committed in the file (its ``admin``/``staticfiles``/
``media`` fixed entries are left alone), then re-renders each module's
sub-surfaces from stapel-tools' CURRENT definition. Drift here means
stapel-tools' own sub-surface list changed since this project was generated
or last regenerated — NOT a full lib-selection re-derivation (that is
``stapel-assemble``'s re-stamp scope; the project's actual INSTALLED_APPS
selection is not reliably recoverable from a generated project's files
across every install mode (pip vs git submodule), so this tool deliberately
does not attempt it — the same "recover from what's already committed"
discipline ``config_manifest.libs_from_existing_config_md`` uses).
