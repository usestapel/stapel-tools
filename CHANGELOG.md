# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- `stapel-new-library` artifact hygiene (top-tier packaging): the generated
  `tests` package is no longer listed in `[tool.setuptools] packages`, so test
  files and `conftest.py` no longer ship inside the built wheel/sdist (the
  flat-layout editable install still resolves `<pkg>.tests.urls` for the test
  `ROOT_URLCONF`, so the scaffold suite stays green). Generated `pyproject.toml`
  now carries a full `[project.urls]` block, completed trove classifiers
  (`License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License`, Python 3.13, `Typing :: Typed`,
  `Intended Audience`, `Operating System`, `Development Status`,
  `Python :: 3 :: Only`) matching the CI matrix, and a `[tool.ruff]` section
  single-sourcing the lint config the git hooks/CI pass on the CLI. Generated
  `.gitignore` now also covers `.ruff_cache/`, `.mypy_cache/`, `coverage.xml`,
  `junit.xml`, `.DS_Store` and `*.err`.
- Dropped an unused `pytest` import in `tests/test_codegen.py` (ruff F401).

### Fixed
- `stapel-create-project --modules <mod>` on **minimal** projects now wires each
  chosen module into `INSTALLED_APPS` and mounts its urls under `/<mod>/api/`,
  not just into `requirements.txt` (G10). A module installed but absent from
  `INSTALLED_APPS` was dead weight; url includes mirror how
  stapel-example-monolith mounts per-module urls. (Monolith already wired
  modules via the service scaffold — covered by new regression tests.)
- Generated **minimal** `requirements.txt` now pins framework ranges
  (`django>=6,<7`, `djangorestframework>=3.14,<4`) — the Django line every
  stapel suite is actually validated on (the source codebases and the
  workspace venv run Django 6; 5.1/5.2 has never been tested) — instead of
  the stale `django>=4.2,<5.0` floor that let a fresh project ride an
  untested Django (G11, version skew). Note: stapel-core still declares
  `Django>=5.1`, an untested claim tracked in
  docs/module-extension-gaps.md.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-07-04
### Added
- `stapel-new-library` — scaffolds a standalone `stapel-*` package repo
  implementing the library standard (workspace `docs/library-standard.md`):
  flat-layout packaging, `STAPEL_<NAME>` conf namespace, comm surface with
  JSON schemas (ping example), serializer seams, MODULE.md skeleton,
  community files, codecov ratchet/floor policy, CI/publish workflows,
  ruff git hooks. Two kinds: `module` (service-capable Django app) and
  `library` (importable L1 package). Generated repo's own tests pass
  out of the box.
